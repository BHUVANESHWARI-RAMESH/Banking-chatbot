 Banking Chatbot – Project Documentation

 1. Problem Statement
Traditional banking customer support systems require human agents to handle repetitive and time-consuming queries such as balance checks, loan information, and FAQs. This leads to increased operational costs and limited availability. There is a need for an intelligent automated system that can handle basic banking queries efficiently and provide instant responses.



 2. Proposed Solution
The Banking Chatbot is an AI-powered virtual assistant that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries and respond appropriately. The chatbot simulates real-world banking operations and provides a secure, interactive conversational interface for customers.



 3. Objectives
 Automate customer support for banking services  
 Provide 24/7 availability  
 Reduce workload on human support staff  
 Demonstrate practical use of NLP in fintech applications  



 4. System Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture:
1. User Interface for chat input  
2. NLP Engine for intent classification  
3. Backend Logic for banking services  
4. Database for storing simulated user data  
5. Response Generator  



 5. Functional Modules
 5.1 User Interaction Module
Handles user inputs and displays chatbot responses.

 5.2 NLP Processing Module
Processes user queries and identifies user intent using NLP techniques.

 5.3 Banking Service Module
Executes banking operations such as balance inquiry, transaction history, and loan eligibility checks.

 5.4 Database Module
Stores simulated banking data securely.



 6. Technology Stack
 Programming Language: Python  
 Backend Framework: Flask  
 NLP Tools: NLTK / spaCy  
 Database: SQLite / JSON  
 Version Control: GitHub
